# Hi there, üëã I'm Hannah, a maniac in analytics
## About me 
#### I've had a long way to realize that a career as a Data Analyst is a perfect fit for me. After trying many studies in Accounting, Finance, Web Design, etc.., I became increasingly aware of the importance of data analytics for business decision making which inspired me to make a serious career with it.
#### As a pure mathematics student, I've always enjoyed a thrill of problem-solving and looking at a problem through different science disciplines, including what a solution might be.‚Äù
