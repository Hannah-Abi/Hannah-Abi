### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hannah, a maniac in analytics

The BA program in the Aalto school of business has given me a precious opportunity to work on many projects that are very close to the real-world project in companies from different industries. Just in my first autumn semester, with my advanced knowledge in Python, I managed to complete a Marketing Analytic project using different machine learning algorithms.  I have also learned how to apply econometric and machine learning models to solve business problems such as cost & revenue optimization with Gurobi, insurance fraud detection.
